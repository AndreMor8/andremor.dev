            My recommended standard when testing Windows beta versions

        <p>
            I was also in that background where I no longer knew whether to test
            the betas as 16 colors or force myself to emulate it with PCem, or
            run the beta without Aero or special graphic features, even without
            a network, but here I will be recompiling which virtualizers to use
            when testing certain Windows builds.

        <p>
            For me, having a pleasant speed, and having all the features of the
            operating system active, is the best way to test a beta version of
            Windows (hardware specific tests do not enter here), so here is the
            list.

        I recommend using VirtualBox, using OS Windows NT 3.x.<br /><br />If for
        some reason it fails, use Other Windows (32-bit).<br /><br />No, giving
        them specific names doesn't help.<br /><br />Use the VirtualBox video
        driver that is compatible from NT 3.1 to Windows 7.<br /><br />Get
        networking with the AMD PC-NET driver.

        For 16-bit versions: I only know that Virtual PC 2007 can run on certain

        For 32-bit versions (NT): I recommend VirtualBox, use the video driver that
        is compatible from NT 3.1 to Windows 7.

        I recommend VirtualBox, use it with Legacy virtualization mode without

        It will depend on the build. Some builds work with VMware with 6.5-7.x
        compatibility mode without ACPI, if this is the case:<br /><br />
        -&gt; Use the video driver that Windows NT 4.0 uses.<br />
        -&gt; Use the VMware 6.5 drivers.<br /><br />
        If it fails with VMware, use VirtualBox (if it fails, without enabling ACPI,

        <br />Some builds like 5219 may require you to use a VMware (the program
        itself) version minor than 12, using higher versions break the way DWM
        works in this build (flickering screen)
        <br /><br />For these two, remember to enable 3D acceleration.
    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <li class="subtitle">Windows 7 (any beta)</li>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
        I recommend VMware, with VMware 10.x support, with the default settings.<br
        /><br />Get Aero features with VMware 11.x (or 14.x) WDDM drivers,
        remember to enable 3D acceleration.
    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <li class="subtitle">Windows 8 and 10 (any beta)</li>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
        With the exception of the Windows 8 builds that still have Aero, use
        VMware, with VMware 10.x support, with the default settings, using the
        11.x (or 14.x) drivers with 3D acceleration enabled.<br /><br />After
        that, I don't think it makes sense to recommend virtualizers, after all
        they are recent systems, and any virtualizer should run them.<br /><br
        />If you still want my opinion, use VMware with the default options.
